<p class="about">
This website is for disseminating <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">SDG</a> indicator data of the Autonomous Region of Asturias in Spain. 
</p>

<p class="about">
These indicators are inspired by the global indicators standarized by the UN, but do not strictly 
correspond to them. Indicators presented here are adapted to the regional level with custom definitions and computation
methodology, following a standard designed in common by the statistics offices of the Autonomous Regions in Spain.
</p>

<p class="about">
Other countries or regions wishing to reuse this data dissemination platform are welcome to do so for free. 
The <a href="https://open-sdg.org/">Open SDG</a> project site highlights key information on how to do this, 
linking to detailed technical instructions available in the platform <a href="https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io">documentation</a>.
